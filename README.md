# FatedGang
It's a gang system that has a lot of functions. You can become an ordinary boss, and together with your participants create "mean deeds", or become an experienced owner, and together with your team arrange battles in Arenas.

Console command to open the menu: `fated_gang_open`

ðŸ”§ [Mantle](https://github.com/darkfated/mantle): in order for the system to work, you need to use this Gmod library

## About the arenas
There is a convenient configuration, the arenas are still being finalized, and if desired, they can be turned off. The concept is that by playing in arenas, gangs get wins as well as the number of kills on the leaderboard. Based on these indicators, the creators of the servers can choose the winners (for example, once a week or a month), and give them gans (gang currency). For this money, the boss can buy a variety of upgrades in the store (getting weapons, something, it all depends on what you do in the config). When the boss buys an item in the store, it is added to the inventory, and now each participant can buy it for 1 game session. Examples: take a knife, pay a usage fee, and run with it to death. If you take the privilege, you will have it (the same VIP) until you get out. And many other variations. There are also opportunities to clean statistics and inventory for gangs.

_Without the arenas enabled, there are only two tabs: the main one and the list of gangs_

## Additional information
- If you are using arenas, download [DayNight System](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1614964558). It is required to keep track of some things
- It is possible that in the future there will be translations into different languages
- I am not against cooperation and your help in development. [Issues](https://github.com/darkfated/fatedgang/issues) are waiting!
